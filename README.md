# 📱 Smartphone Price Analytics & Market Strategy – 2025

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes smartphone pricing trends in 2025, examines how brand, hardware specifications, and network support (5G) impact market pricing, and evaluates whether machine learning models can predict smartphone prices.
The insights are visualized using Tableau, and predictions are modeled using Python (Scikit-Learn).

## 🧠 Machine Learning Prediction

Two ML algorithms were trained:

Model	-- R² Score	-- MAE --	RMSE
🔸Linear Regression -- 	-0.07 -- 	₹372.47	-- ₹431.52
🔸Random Forest	-- -0.08 --	₹373.91 --	₹434.42

> Insight: Price prediction is difficult using only hardware specs.
Brand and software optimization strongly influence pricing.

## 📌 Market Insights (From Tableau Story)

🔍 Key Findings

🔺RAM, Display Size, and Charging Speed increase price significantly.

🔺5G phones are costlier due to high demand & production cost.

🔺iPhones stay expensive even with similar hardware due to brand value.


## 🏭 Recommendations for Brands

🚀Focus on balanced features (Camera + Battery + 5G) for mid-range success.

🚀Launch budget 5G devices to target India and emerging markets.

🚀Promote software & AI performance, not just hardware.


## 👥 Recommendations for Consumers

🎯High price does not always mean better performance.

🎯Mid-range phones offer best price-to-performance in 2025.

🎯Compare RAM, Display, Charging, not just brand.
